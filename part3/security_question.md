As the leader of the Engineering team of an tech startup that installs solar panels through an app, our main focus is to ensure the security of our technological infrastructure. We have drawn inspiration from the OWASP Top 10 security model of 2021 to assess potential security issues that could impact our system. Our infrastructure is based on Kubernetes containers hosted on Amazon Web Services and comprises several key components. These include a mobile app for Android and iOS, a web frontend developed in Javascript with Next.js, and a MySQL database that stores customer information. A Python backend implemented with FastAPI communicates with both the web frontend and mobile apps.

Furthermore, it's important to note that we have 12 software engineering employees with full system access, 3 customer support employees with permissions to view customer information and make changes to orders and accounts, and one sales employee.

Therefore, the actions I would take would be as follows:

1. **Mobile Application for Android and iOS (A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures)**:

   - **Secure Authentication and Authorization**:
     - Implement a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure that only authorized users have access to appropriate functions and data.
     - Use two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible to enhance the security of user accounts.

   - **Secure Data Storage on Mobile Devices (A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures)**:
     - Encrypt data stored on mobile devices to prevent unauthorized access in case of loss or theft.

   - **Protection Against Reverse Engineering and Code Obfuscation (A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures)**:
     - Implement measures to protect the mobile application code against reverse engineering and the extraction of sensitive information.

   - **SSL Pinning (A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures)**:
    - Implement SSL pinning to ensure that connections between the mobile application and servers are made only with trusted certificates. This reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures secure and reliable communication.

2. **Web Frontend (Next.js) (A05:2021-Incorrect Security Configuration)**:

   - **Web Application Security (A03:2021-Injection)**:
     - Implement security controls in the web application to protect it against common attacks such as code injection and XSS attacks.
     - Regularly verify that the libraries and components used are up to date and free from known vulnerabilities. Keeping dependencies up to date is essential to avoid security risks.

   - **Input Validation and Output Escaping (A03:2021-Injection)**:
     - Properly validate and escape all input and output data to prevent injection and XSS attacks.

3. **MySQL Database (A04:2021-Insecure Design)**:

   - **Database Security (A01:2021-Access Control Loss)**:
     - Apply database security policies, such as strong authentication, role-based access, and database auditing to control access and track activities.

   - **Secure Password Storage (A02:2021-Cryptographic Failure)**:
     - Use secure hash algorithms and salting functions to store customer passwords securely.

   - **Sensitive Data Encryption (A02:2021-Cryptographic Failure)**:
     - Consider encrypting sensitive data, such as home addresses and phone numbers, in the database, depending on specific security and compliance requirements. The encryption of this data may be optional and will depend on risk assessment and organization security policies.

4. **Python Backend with FastAPI (A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures)**:

   - **API Security**:
     - Implement strong authentication and authorization to control access to the APIs.
     - Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for API authentication and authorization.
     - Regularly verify that the libraries and components used are up to date and free from known vulnerabilities. Keeping dependencies up to date is essential to avoid security risks.

   - **Input Data Validation (A03:2021-Injection)**:
     - Carefully validate and filter input data to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection and command attacks.

   - **DDoS Protection (A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures)**:
     - Implement measures to mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in your backend.

   - **Protection Against Brute Force Attacks (A01:2021-Access Control Loss)**:
     - Implement protection measures against brute force attacks, such as the implementation of CAPTCHAs or logical challenges in exposed interfaces to mitigate unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Employees and System Access (A01:2021-Access Control Loss)**:

   - **Employee Access Management (A09:2021-Registration and Monitoring Failures)**:
     - Implement an access management system that allows granting employees the minimum necessary permissions based on their responsibilities.

   - **Security Training (A09:2021-Registration and Monitoring Failures)**:
     - Provide security training to employees so they are aware of best practices and security risks.

6. **Audit and Activity Logging (A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures)**:

   - Implement an activity logging system that allows tracking who accesses what data and what actions are taken in the system. This is crucial for detecting and responding to potential security breaches.

7. **Monitoring and Incident Response (A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures)**:

   - Establish a continuous security monitoring system for identifying and responding quickly to potential threats or security breaches.

8. **Security Testing and Penetration Assessments (A03:2021-Injection)**:

   - Conduct regular security testing and penetration assessments to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your system before attackers can exploit them.

9. **Secure Error Handling (A03:2021-Injection)**:

   - Implement secure error handling so that error messages do not reveal sensitive information or technical details that can be exploited by attackers.
